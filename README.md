## Overview

This site is a copy of existing Minimo page layout created to practice front-end development.

## Installing

### 1. Download the npm modules that are declared in your package.json file. This can be done by:

- opening a terminal window

- changing into the directory that you have saved the package.json and gulpfile.js files

- running the following command:

  npm install

If this does not work you may need administrator permissions on your computer, you can run the following command in that instance:

    sudo npm install

### 2. Open your terminal window and change into the root directory of your project and run the command:

    npm run build

This should start compiling all of CSS and HTML files and output them into a folder called ‘dist’.

To continously watch changes in 'src' folder:

    npm run watch

You can also run the following commands to compile CSS and HTML files individually:

    npm run clean

    npm run html

    npm run sass
